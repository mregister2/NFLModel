#Remove games that end in a tie. 8 games. Make "Result" a binary categorical variable ("WIN", "LOSS")

#Create new variable: TravelDelta = TravelDist-OppTravelDist. This variable can replace both TravelDist and OppTravelDist in model.

#Create new variable: RestDelta = Rest-OppRest. Can replace both Rest and OppRest in model.
